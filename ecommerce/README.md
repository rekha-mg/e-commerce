# Installing UI comonents 


`composer require laravel/ui`
- This wont install if php version is less 7.4

`php artisan ui vue`
- This might give error related to js/ folder due to laravel 7 & 8 folder strcuture
- To fix it, copy public/js folder into resources/js

Resource/js/app.js -> this is first file for Vue.js
- Here we will import Vue and all Vue components
- when you run `npm run delopment` or `npm run watch` npm will pick webpack.mix.js and it will new public/js/app.js everytime you execute the command. This is called front end code compliation.


Fix web route for Vue.js
- Add any route in routes/web.js and inform laravel to send it to app view (app.blade.php)
- from app.blade.php Vue.js will take care everything.
- In app.blade.php we will link compiled public/js/app.js as javascript.


Install npm install --save vue-router
